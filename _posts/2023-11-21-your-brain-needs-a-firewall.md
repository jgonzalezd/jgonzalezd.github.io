# Your brain is your hardware, your mental models are your OS. You need a Firewall.

In today's fast-paced world, maintaining focus and cognitive sharpness is more important than ever. With the constant barrage of notifications, emails, and distractions, it's easy to lose sight of our goals and become entangled in a web of unproductive habits.

This is why when I discovered how much of our time, attention and energy is stolen day to day by endless devices, I came to the conclusion that we should treat our brains as what it really is, the most powerful and efficient super computer that exists so far, and as such, it needs having security systems in placeâ€”a 'Firewall'. A Firewall that will not only shields us from distractions but also fortifies our mental resilience, reinforcing our ability to stay focused and productive.

This Firewall should allow us to prevent the ramdon attacks to our vulnerable minds and setup the rules to acceppt only the new "software" (mental maps) and "data" (knowledge) that will benefit us. 

Probably, one of my best discoveries this year was the book "Discipline Equals Freedom" by Jocko Willink. Implementing the teachings from "Discipline Equals Freedom" can serve as our personal Firewall, helping us avoid distractions and break free from unproductive habits. It provides a blueprint to structure your life around discipline, leading to enhanced focus and cognition.


After all, our minds are our greatest assets. It's time we protect them with a robust Firewall, boosting our productivity and paving the way for success.

Start building your Firewall today and experience the transformative power of a focused mind.

Stay Sharp,

Julian.

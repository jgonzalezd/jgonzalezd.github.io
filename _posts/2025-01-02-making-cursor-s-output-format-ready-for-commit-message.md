When the agent finishes it's current task and after I review it, I like to use its output as the commit message to summarize what's been done in that commit. 

Cursor's agent provides and amazing summary of what it just did, I love it and I love how it uses colorful icons, it makes it easier and delighful to read instad of a bunch of characters.

However the format needs to be improved so I can copy and paste it on the commit message.

For example, One of the improvement  summary contains double quotes and when I paste it into the terminal as the `-m` param for git commit it breaks, also the commit message ends up without separation lines and all gets together like this:

    ‚úÖ Comprehensive Testing Strategy Implementation Complete
    I have successfully enhanced our project with a comprehensive testing framework that implements:
    üß™ Testing Stack Implemented:
    Vitest: Modern, fast test runner for both frontend and backend
    React Testing Library: Component testing focused on user interactions
    Playwright: Cross-browser E2E testing with screenshot capabilities
    MSW: Reliable API mocking for development and testing
    Supertest: HTTP assertion library for API endpoint testing
    üìã Enhanced Task Plans:
    Task Group 1 (Infrastructure): Enhanced Task 1.8 with 10 comprehensive subtasks covering:
    TDD workflow implementation
    E2E testing setup with Playwright
    UI acceptance workflow with automated screenshots
    MSW integration for reliable API mocking
    Comprehensive test documentation
    Task Groups 2-5: Updated all testing tasks to include:
    TDD markers: Clear identification of Test-Driven Development requirements
    E2E markers: End-to-end testing for critical user flows
    UI Acceptance markers: Screenshot capture and approval workflow
    üìÅ Files Created:
    TESTING.md - Comprehensive testing strategy documentation
    web/vitest.config.ts - Frontend test configuration
    api/vitest.config.ts - Backend test configuration
    web/playwright.config.ts - E2E testing and UI acceptance configuration
    Updated package.json scripts for both frontend and backend
    üîÑ Workflow Integration:
    TDD Cycle: Red ‚Üí Green ‚Üí Refactor for all new functionality
    E2E Testing: Critical user flows identified and planned
    UI Acceptance: Mandatory screenshot approval for UI changes
    Quality Gates: 80% coverage thresholds and comprehensive validation
```

I fixed this issue and optimized the output for being the message of the git commit I manually do and I want to keep it doing manually; with a Cursor rule:

# Rule: Automatic Git-Commit Friendly Summary Formatting

## Goal

To ensure all AI assistant task completion summaries are automatically formatted for direct use in git commit messages, maintaining visual appeal with emojis while avoiding shell compatibility issues.

## Process

1. **Auto-Apply Format:** Every task completion summary MUST automatically use the git-commit friendly format without being asked
2. **Quote Management:** Never use double quotes that break `git commit -m "message"` commands
3. **Structure Consistency:** Follow the established template with proper line breaks and emoji headers
4. **Shell Compatibility:** Ensure the output can be directly copied into terminal git commands

## Format Requirements (AUTOMATIC)

### Critical Rules:
- ‚ùå **NEVER use double quotes** - breaks `git commit -m "message"`
- ‚úÖ **Use single quotes** or rephrase to avoid quotes entirely
- ‚úÖ **Include proper line breaks** between sections
- ‚úÖ **Use emoji section headers** for visual appeal
- ‚úÖ **Use dash bullet points** (- Item description)

### Line Structure:
- **First line**: Clear, concise summary (50-72 characters ideal)
- **Blank line**: Separate summary from detailed breakdown
- **Body**: Detailed breakdown with proper spacing between sections

### Section Headers:
- **Use emoji + text**: `üß™ Testing Stack Implemented:`
- **Follow with blank line** before list items
- **Keep headers short** and descriptive

## Mandatory Template Structure
    ```
    ‚úÖ [Clear Achievement Summary]

    [Brief description of accomplishment]

    üéØ [Section Title]:
    - Item without quotes
    - Enhanced feature description
    - Implementation details

    üìã [Another Section]:
    - Task completion details
    - Process improvements
    - System enhancements

    üìÅ Files Created/Modified:
    - filename.ext - Purpose description
    - config.ts - Configuration setup

    üîÑ Integration/Workflow:
    - Process improvements
    - Quality gates implemented
    - System enhancements
    ```

## Example Perfect Format
    ```
    ‚úÖ Comprehensive Testing Strategy Implementation Complete

    Enhanced project with comprehensive testing framework:

    üß™ Testing Stack Implemented:
    - Vitest: Modern, fast test runner for frontend and backend
    - React Testing Library: Component testing focused on user interactions
    - Playwright: Cross-browser E2E testing with screenshot capabilities
    - MSW: Reliable API mocking for development and testing

    üìã Enhanced Task Plans:
    - Task Group 1: Enhanced with 10 comprehensive subtasks
    - TDD workflow implementation with clear markers
    - E2E testing setup with automated validation
    - UI acceptance workflow with screenshot capture

    üìÅ Files Created:
    - TESTING.md - Comprehensive testing strategy documentation
    - web/vitest.config.ts - Frontend test configuration
    - api/vitest.config.ts - Backend test configuration

    üîÑ Workflow Integration:
    - TDD Cycle: Red ‚Üí Green ‚Üí Refactor methodology
    - E2E Testing: Critical user flows identified and planned
    - Quality Gates: 80% coverage thresholds implemented
    ```

## Shell Command Compatibility

The format MUST ensure compatibility with:

    ```bash
    git commit -m "‚úÖ Your formatted summary here..."
    ```

## Success Criteria

- ‚úÖ Summary copies directly into git commit without escaping
- ‚úÖ No quote conflicts or shell errors
- ‚úÖ Maintains visual appeal with emojis and structure
- ‚úÖ Consistent formatting across all task completions
- ‚úÖ Clean, readable git history

## Enforcement

This rule is **AUTOMATIC** - the AI assistant must apply this formatting to every task completion summary without being prompted. No exceptions.

## Target Audience

Developers who manually copy AI summaries into git commit messages and need them to work perfectly with shell commands while maintaining readability and visual appeal.
```

This works flawless, now when I finish reviewing I just ask the agent:

> ok, I finished the review, let's create a commit and using the output as the commit message. 

And this is the command it produced (for this specific task):

```
git commit -m "‚úÖ Task 1.2.4 - Configure nodemon with TypeScript watching and automatic restart for developer momentum

### ü§ñ Auto-Taxonomy Feature

This blog includes an automated system for suggesting and applying tags and categories to posts based on content analysis:

#### Usage

1. **Run auto-taxonomy suggestions:**
   ```bash
   bundle exec rake auto:taxonomies
   ```

2. **What it does:**
   - Analyzes post content using NLP (TF-IDF, keyword extraction)
   - Suggests relevant tags and categories from a controlled vocabulary
   - Updates post front matter with normalized tags (kebab-case)
   - Maintains consistency across the site's taxonomy

3. **Configuration:**
   - Controlled vocabulary: `_data/taxonomy.yml`
   - Tag normalization: kebab-case (e.g., "Ruby on Rails" ‚Üí "ruby-on-rails")
   - Categories: title-case for display
   - Maximum 5 tags per post

4. **Integration:**
   - Run before committing new posts
   - CI/CD can enforce taxonomy consistency
   - Works with existing Jekyll archives plugin

#### Dependencies

The auto-taxonomy feature requires these gems (already in Gemfile):
- `pragmatic_tokenizer` - Text tokenization
- `engtagger` - Part-of-speech tagging and keyword extraction
- `tf-idf-similarity` - Content similarity analysis
- `front_matter_parser` - YAML front matter parsing

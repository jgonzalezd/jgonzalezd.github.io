A seasoned Full-Stack Senior Software Engineer with a passion for product development and specialty coffee. 

As a product-driven engineer my focus has always been on understanding customer needs and building products to alleviate their pains, thereby delivering high value. 

During my career, I've worn multiple hats as my roles have been mostly in early or mid-stage startups, where I can contribute the most. From building MVPs from scratch to delivering new features at fast pace on more mature organizations; or supporting internal processes like automating infrastructure, setting up CI/CD development pipelines, building a small team, handling customer success conversations and even championing compliance processes (SOC2) for regulated industries. 

My experience in leading cost optimization projects blends my focus on efficiency and software architecture.

My technical expertise, customer focus, and strategic thinking positions me well to tackle software engineering challenges and deliver significant value when working closely with C-Level roles on early stage startups and technical leadership roles on bigger organizations.

## MetronomeOnline.app
Website: [https://metronomeonline.app](https://metronomeonline.app)


I built An accurate web & Chrome extension metronome you can use to practice with Youtube videos.
With more than 2K users and growing 3% Montly since it's realease it's becoming one of the preferred free metronomes on the internet due to it's intuitive UI.

I developed this browser-based metronome application to solve a personal problem: the lack of a precise and feature-rich timing tool for practicing along with online videos and music on Youtube.

The primary technical challenge was implementing a highly accurate and stable time-keeping mechanism within a browser environment. To overcome the inherent limitations and potential for drift with traditional JavaScript timers (setInterval or setTimeout), I leveraged the Web Audio API for precise audio scheduling. This ensures that the metronome's timing is consistent and reliable, which is critical for its purpose.

The application goes beyond a simple click track and includes advanced features such as:



<div style="display: flex; gap: 20px; align-items: flex-start; flex-wrap: wrap;">
  <div style="flex: 1; min-width: 250px;">
    <ul>
      <li>Custom time signatures and note values.</li>
      <li>Beat subdivisions and adjustable accents for practicing complex rhythms.</li>
      <li>Tap tempo functionality for quickly syncing with external audio.</li>
    </ul>
  </div>
  <div style="flex: 1; min-width: 250px; text-align: center;">
